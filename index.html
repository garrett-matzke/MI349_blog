                <p>NIL which is name, image and likeness has taken over college football and I think there needs to be more rules in place to help control it. The big scools with large donaters can basically pay the best players to come to there school. They are even offering players from other schools large sums oif money to transfer and make there program better.</p>
                <p>I think it is unfair for schools who do not have big donaters to try and go compete for the top players. I think to fix these each school should should be capped at a certain amount they can spend if they are going to pay players.
                <p>I think college football should go back to not paying players to even out the playing field and that way powerhouse schools may not always be powerhouses, which means better competition.
                <p>Hereâ€™s the top 3 NIL earners</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Player</th>
                            <th>School</th>
                            <th>Value</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Arch Manning</td>
                            <td>Texas</td>
                            <td>$5.5M</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Carson Beck</td>
                            <td>Miami</td>
                            <td>$4.9M</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Jeremiah Smith</td>
                            <td>Ohio State</td>
                            <td>$4.2M</td>
                        </tr>

                <h2>Arificial Turf in Football</h2>

            <section>
                <p>Artifical turf in college and pro football is becoming more common because of the low maintenece. The downside is the amount of injuries that come from artifial turf because of it not being natural. It is widely known all football players would much rather play on real grass than turf.</p>
                <p>The amount of non contact injuries that occur on turf compared to grass is quite large. When I say non contact I mean the player is injured without coming in contact with another player. The most common amd possibly the worst injuries are non contact such as ACL, MCL and achillies injuries which are all very detrimental to a player and there longevity.</p>
                <p>I think they really need to look at the numbers on how many players have non contact injuries on turf compared to real grass. I have personally watched many players end there season early due to a non contact injury like an ACL tear on turf and depending on the player it could ruin a teams season hopes of going to the playoffs. One example is Metlife statdium in New York and the maount of non contact injuries on that field is very high and is known as one of the most dangerous fields to play on.</p>
