                <p>NIL which is name, image and likeness has taken over college football and I think there needs to be more rules in place to help control it. The big scools with large donaters can basically pay the best players to come to there school. They are even offering players from other schools large sums oif money to transfer and make there program better. </p>
                <p>I think it is unfair for schools who do not have big donaters to try and go compete for the top players. I think to fix thgese each school should should be capped at a certain amount they can spend if they are going to pay players.</p>
                <p>I think college football should go back to not paying players to even out the playing field and that way powerhouse schools may not always be powerhouses.</p>
                <p>Here’s a sample of my morning routine schedule:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Time</th>
                            <th>Activity</th>
                            <th>Benefit</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>6:30 AM</td>
                            <td>Drink Water</td>
                            <td>Hydration</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>6:35 AM</td>
                            <td>Meditation</td>
                            <td>Calm Mind</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>6:50 AM</td>
                            <td>Read</td>
                            <td>Inspiration</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>Digital art has revolutionized the way we create and experience visual media. From graphic design to animation, the possibilities are endless. As an artist, I’ve found digital tools to be both liberating and challenging. The ability to experiment with colors, shapes, and textures without the constraints of physical materials opens up new avenues for creativity.</p>
                <p>One of the most exciting aspects of digital art is the community. Online platforms allow artists to share their work, receive feedback, and collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world. This global network fosters innovation and helps artists grow.</p>
                <p>Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting out, digital art offers something for everyone. The learning curve can be steep, but with practice and patience, anyone can master the basics. I encourage you to explore tutorials, join online forums, and most importantly, create regularly.</p>
                <p>Remember, art is about expression. Don’t be afraid to try new things and make mistakes. Every piece you create is a step forward in your artistic journey.</p>
